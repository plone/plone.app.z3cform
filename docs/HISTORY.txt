=========

------------------

* Render errors from group form widget manager validators.  Fixes
  http://code.google.com/p/dexterity/issues/detail?id=96
  [davisagli]

* Default to showing the default fieldset, rather than the first non-default
  fieldset.
  [davisagli]

* Replace the required field indicator image with a unicode box, refs
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10352
  [davisagli, limi]

* Replaced the existing radiobutton-based boolean widget with the standard
  single checkbox Plone version.
  [limi]

* Add @@ploneform-render-widget view, so that the widget chrome can be
  customized for particular widget types.
  [davisagli]

* Added slots to the ``titlelessform`` macro. See ``README.txt`` in
  ``plone.z3cform`` for details.
  [optilude, davisagli]

* Cleaned up templates to match Plone 4 conventions.
  [optilude]

* Made templates and inline validation work with standalone forms as supported
  by plone.z3cform 0.6 and later.
  [optilude]

* Installed a browser layer IPloneFormLayer with this package's extension
  profile. This inherits from z3c.form's IFormLayer, allowing the default
  widgets to work. You should always install this package in
  portal_quickinstaller before using z3c.form forms in Plone.
  [optilude]

* Made the textlines widget the default for sequence types with text/ascii
  line value types. The default widget from z3c.form is too confusing.
  [optilude]
  
* Use form method defined in form class. This allows HTTP GET forms.
  Before method was hardcoded to "post" in the template. [miohtama]

0.4.9 - 2010-01-08
------------------

* Remove unused (and broken on Plone 4) lookup of the current user's WYSIWYG
  editor preference.  The wysiwyg_support template does this for us.
  [davisagli]


0.4.8 - 2009-10-23
------------------

* Made the KSS validator use publish traversal instead of OFS traversal to find
  the form. This makes it usable with forms reached by custom IPublishTraverse
  adapters.
  [davisagli]

* Added enable_form_tabbing option to not transform fieldsets into tabs.
  [vincentfretin]

* Added an id to the generated form.
  [vincentfretin]

* Fixed issue in macros.pt: fieldset.current hidden input was never generated.
  [vincentfretin]


0.4.7 - 2009-09-25
------------------

* Set plone i18n domain for "Info" and "Error" messages in macros.pt so they are translated.
  [vincentfretin]


0.4.6 - 2009-07-26
------------------

* Include plone.z3cform's overrides.zcml from our own overrides.zcml.
  [optilude]

* Updated to collective.z3cform.datetimewidget>=0.1a2 to fix a ZCML conflict
  with z3c.form.
  [davisagli]


0.4.5 - 2009-05-25
------------------

* Made the KSS form support conditional on both kss.core and Archetypes being
  installed.
  [hannosch]

* Use the date/time widgets from collective.z3cform.datetimewidget as the default
  widget for Date and Datetime fields.
  [davisagli]


0.4.4 - 2009-05-03
------------------

* Made the KSS validator use traversal instead of getMultiAdapter() to find
  the form. This makes it work on add forms.
  See http://code.google.com/p/dexterity/issues/detail?id=27
  [optilude]


0.4.3 - 2009-04-17
------------------

* Added a display template for the WYSIWYG widget.
  [optilude]

* Make the ?fieldset.current query string variable work. Set it to the id
  of a fieldset other than default to pre-select a different fieldset, e.g.
  .../@@formview?fieldset.current=3
  [optilude]

* Hide the 'default' fieldset if there's nothing to show there.
  [optilude]

* Provide 'portal' variable in wysiwyg template, as its used by some editors.
  [davisagli]


0.4.2 - 2008-09-04
------------------

* Make the WYSIWYG widget work also for non-Acquisition wrapped
  content.


0.4.1 - 2008-08-21
------------------

* Removed maximum version dependency on zope.component. This should be left
  to indexes, known good sets or explicit version requirements in buildouts.
  If you work with zope.component >= 3.5 you will also need five.lsm >= 0.4.
  [hannosch]

* Make use of new plone.z3cform support for looking up the layout template by
  adapter. This means that forms now no longer need to depend on
  plone.app.z3cform unless they want to use Plone-specific widgets.


0.4.0 - 2008-07-31
------------------

* Add inline validation support with KSS

* Require zope.component <= 3.4.0 to prevent compatibility issues with
  five.localsitemanager, of which a buggy version (0.3) is pinned by
  plone.recipe.plone 3.1.4.  Upgrade to this version if you're seeing::
    
    ...
    Module five.localsitemanager.registry, line 176, in registeredUtilities
    ValueError: too many values to unpack


0.3.2 - 2008-07-25
------------------

* Fixed a bug in macros.pt where 'has_groups' and 'show_default_label'
  for fieldsets were set in the 'form' macro, rendering the 'field'
  macro unusable by itself.


0.3.1 - 2008-07-24
------------------

* Fixed a bug where we would use the form macros defined in
  plone.z3cform instead of our own.


0.3 - 2008-07-24
----------------

* Create this package from Plone-specific bits that have been factored
  out of plone.z3cform.
